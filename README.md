## ⚡ CORE OBJECTIVE
Neural_Vault is a high-performance WebGL application that transforms audio frequency data into 12+ procedural mathematical realms. It generates a unique "DNA Seed" for every track, allowing users to capture and share their sonic discoveries as high-definition digital posters.

## 🛠 TECH_STACK
- **Engine:** Next.js 14 (App Router)
- **Visuals:** React Three Fiber (Three.js) + GLSL Shaders
- **State:** Zustand (High-frequency state management)
- **Backend:** Supabase (Auth + PostgreSQL + Realtime Sync)
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS + Framer Motion (Glassmorphism HUD)

---

## 🧬 PROCEDURAL_REALMS
The engine supports 12+ mathematical mappings, including:
- **0x00 Torus Knot:** Braided orbital particles.
- **0x02 DNA Archive:** Double-helix structural mapping.
- **0x08 Quantum Foam:** Wave-particle duality simulation.
- **0x11 Quantum Pringle:** Hyperbolic paraboloid geometry.

Ignite Engine:

Bash

npm run dev
📡 SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE
/components/NeuralCanvas: The WebGL heartbeat. Handles particle interpolation and audio-reactivity.

/lib/realmCalculations: The mathematical core. Contains the trigonometry for all 12+ realms.

/store/useStore: The central nervous system. Syncs audio nodes with 3D uniforms.

/components/PosterGenerator: The viral engine. Captures 1080p snapshots for social sharing.

🛡 ARCHITECT_ACCESS
To enable God Mode (Realm Editor) and Community Gallery features, users must establish a Neural Identity via the integrated Supabase Auth module.
